demoHeatIndex
=============

GSA Chop Shop code demo - this demonstrates how some of the business and UI logic found in the OSHA Heat Index mobile app for iOS can be reused. The main methods are now found in the HeatIndex class. The AlertBox class passes parameters to the alertBox method stored in the ViewController.

The demo MainViewController contains methods for calling the methods in the Heat Index. You can change the parameters in the MainViewController.m file and see the changes in the UI.

Note that the original app has methods that call and process NOAA data, these methods have not been included in this demo app.
